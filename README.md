# Portfolio-Page

## Description

This is a growing and changing Portfolio Page to highlight my work during and after UCI Web Development Bootcamp.

- With this Portfolio you can better understand my technical skills and what I can bring to your company.
  
- Not only will this website highlight my projects, this is also my first website and will be going through changes as I learn and grow as a Developer.
  
- Developing this website I learned that the applications of CSS are vast and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
